Dynamic Electricity Pricing Simulator - Zambia
A real-time web application that demonstrates a flexible electricity billing system designed to promote energy conservation and fair pricing in Zambian households.

Project Overview
This simulator addresses the challenge of traditional fixed-rate electricity billing by implementing a dynamic pricing model that rewards energy-conscious users and penalizes excessive consumption. The system encourages sustainable energy usage through real-time feedback and incentive-based pricing.

Key Features

Dynamic Pricing Algorithm: Households below baseline usage receive discounts, while those above pay penalties
Real-time Monitoring: Live tracking of hourly electricity consumption and costs
Interactive Simulation: Adjustable parameters for baseline usage, rates, and penalty/reward factors
Realistic Usage Patterns: Simulates typical daily electricity consumption with morning and evening peaks
Visual Analytics: Interactive charts showing hourly usage trends and daily cost comparisons
Multi-household Comparison: Compare three different household types (energy-conscious, high-consumption, average)

Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js with Hooks
Charts: Recharts library for data visualization
Styling: Inline CSS (no external dependencies)
State Management: React useState and useEffect
